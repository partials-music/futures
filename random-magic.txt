I'm younger than when I left
temporal timbres
sand quickening
sand quickening

we are memories of ourselves
looking at the present through a one-way mirror
the constant bound by space and time
man made of moments

there is sand at the bottom of the ocean
tapestry of abstract engineering
I wish I had more to do so I could spend less time with you
tides swallowing the dunes

moss grows on things once great
the moon melts and reshapes itself
what was and what might not be
every moment is this moment

an empty house on a lavender island
memory made man
I'm younger than when I left
my mind used to race much more

I lost myself for a time
sand quickening
tapestry of abstract engineering
