there is sand at the bottom of the ocean
the tide melts and reshapes itself
  currents melt and reshape themselves
  a tapestry of abstract engineering
into what was and what might not be
currents swallowing the dunes
  tides swallow the dunes

we are memories of ourselves
looking at the present through a one-way mirror

there is sand slipping through your fingers
  moss grown on things once great
the moon melts and reshapes itself
into what was and what might not be
every moment is this moment
  tides swallowing the dunes
  this moment is every moment

we are memories of ourselves
looking at the present through a one-way mirror

an empty house on a lavender island
  an empty house on an empty island
with memory made man
the constant bound by space and time
a man made of moments

we are memories of ourselves
looking at the present through a one-way mirror

---

younger than when I left
my mind used to race much more

I lost myself for a time
sand quickening
a tapestry of abstract engineering

the constant bound by space and time
a man made of moments

I'm younger than when I left
temporal timbres
sand quickening
sand quickening
