--- background

WE ARE THE MEMORIES OF OUR FUTURE SELVES

the narrator's Present self is talking to their Future self

the conflict is that Present doesn't like Future
  around twenty, "i'm gonna do x, y, and z"
  by thirty, you should've already done x, y, and z
for drawing on personal experiences, ask what our late teen selves would think about our present self

--- lyrics

# verse one

we planned to make it, planned to make it up,
keep our words in hand,
  keep our plans in hand,
'til our dreams became a thing
  but your things are not a thing
  all the things are still a thing
  all the things that aren't a thing
  all the things for all the things
  all the things yeah all the things
  all the things but all the things
  all the things and all the things
  all the things ands all the things
  many x y zs, all the things you should've been
  thirty night time fires

our futures should be at our feet
where's our cosmogram?
where's our cosmogram?

# chorus

the future can see you
moving in memories
  your moments can come apart
  the moments that come apart
wanting to know how
  wanting to meet you
  waiting to be you
do you see me?
  quite intently
  the door's about to close

the future can see you
  moving in circles
caught up in symmetries
wanting to know do
  wanting to know would
  wanting to meet you
  waiting to be you
you believe me?
  quite intently
  the door's about to close

# verse two

I came to nothing just to meet with you
  I came to nothing just to come to you
there's this thing I do
with the light behind my eyes

let it trickle on the dying fire
feel the earth unglue
and tomorrow seeping through

# chorus

the future can see you
moving in memories
wanting to know how
do you see me?

the future can see you
caught up in symmetries
wanting to know do
you believe me?
