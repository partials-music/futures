making dust out of bricks
making mud out of bricks
life during wartime
no sleep
war of times
time of war
sands of an hourglass
flip it over
time pours like rain
buried up to your neck in sand
dunes eroding
tides swallowing the dunes
there is sand at the bottom of the ocean
sand falls but doesn't disappear
I wish I had more to do so I could spend less time with you
quicksand
sand quickening
the quick sands of time
waterfall of dust
time used to flow
much slower of course
my mind used to race
much more than yours
shoveling sand
time has been unkind
time has been kind
a kind of time
this kind of time has been unkind
the hiss of sand falling on sand
when do grains become a dune?
like trying to find a grain of sand in a sand dune
what is a dune but a collection of grains
what is an ocean but a collection of drops?
when you have the time to think
just think about the times
when you had the time to breathe
welcome home
breathing in sand
my breath choked and fluttered, breathing in sand
times of change
the times are changed, and in them changed are we
fall moves to winter, winter moves to fall
the moon melts
the moon reshapes itself
the fingers of trees grow then die
the fingers of trees die then grow
do you remember when you were born?
how old were you when you were born?
time changes you
you'll be different when you remember this day
will the you that is you right now even remember this day?
you're not the same person I once was
when you look back, you will not see yourself
it stays with you no matter who you are
constant is the only change
space of time
the friction of distance
a minute and a meter
don't look at the clock
things change when you're apart
time slows when we're closer
distance makes difference

distance heals all wounds
the rate of change is changing
the space time clock
the space clock
event horizons
light bends time and time bends light
great structures tetrised together in a tapestry of abstract engineering
moss grows on things once great
look on my works ye mighty and despair
crumbling stone that once was brick
picture yourself in a time at a place
gone now, but influenced laters
an empty house on a lavender island
people lived here for a billion years
what once was home is home no more
what is is what was
and ever shall be
I was, therefore I am
where I think, I am
when I think, I am
I lost myself for a time
the world makes you forgetful
thorny paths deep in the hedge
hand myself over
every moment is this moment
a line from the beginning to the end
begin at the beginning
and when you get to the end, stop
we are made of our memories
will you a be a good memory? or a bad memory?
you're the memories that make up your future
we make ourselves
we make ourselves up as we go along
we are made of ourselves
we are memories of ourselves
your future self is looking at you right now through memories
looking back on your future (second character to first character)
I can't remember who I should be
all lines lead to time
all lines are made in time
man made of moments
a person is a sum
sum person
man made memories
memory made man
all memories
memory murmurs
reliving a memory
swept up in the current of time
our future should be present now
our future would be present now
our presence is the present
time dilated
I'm younger than when I left
dilated eyes and dilated time
tempered by time
riding on a wave of light
let's do ____ again
timing is everything
looking back, time dilated
it felt like a minute, but it was a year
and the days go by
letting the days go by
flow down the river
take me to the river of time
catching fish in the river of time
whirlpools
a spiral river
as I went down the river astray
what you are is what you were
will you like what you become?
will you be what you want to be?
disgust met with understanding
the length of my pause was the length of your blink
I couldn't do what was already done
this could be for past or future
look at your past, but don't stare
look at your future, but don't stare
frames of myself
look at the present, but where do you look?
now is now but now just passed
all moments are fleeting and none last
making futures
time in a circuit
circuitous time
a digital clock is always wrong
a time of wrinkles
wrinkled geometry
drop in a penny and get out the present
keep down the dust
I planned to build you from the bottom up,
many xs ys zs, all the things you should've been

speaking in memories
the future can see you
the moments can come apart
moving in circles
door's about to close
I came to nothing just to meet with you
I came to nothing just to come to you
I can feel the puzzle of your muscles
time logic
the future's looking at the present through a one-way mirror
meet me somewhere
make ready for the future king
half to burn and half fulfill you
live our lives like a moment
as if it didn't happen
if it didn't happen, I can't remember it
if I can't remember, it didn't happen
if it's not happening, I can't remember
I went before you
who cares to die for the dream of being?
