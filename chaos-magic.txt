# verse 1

there is sand at the bottom of the ocean
the tide melts and reshapes itself
  currents melt and reshape themselves
  a tapestry of abstract engineering
into what was and what might not be
the currents all swallowing the dunes
  tides swallow the dunes

# chorus

we are memories
of our selves looking at the
present through a
one-way mirror

we are memories
of our selves looking at the
present through a
one-way mirror

# verse 2

there is sand slipping through your fingers
  moss grown on things once great
the moon melts and reshapes itself
into what was and what might not be
we make ourselves up as we go along
|| when you look back, you will see yourself
  time stands still when youâ€™re not yourself
  then you melt and reshape yourself
  every moment is this moment
  tides swallowing the dunes
  this moment is every moment

# chorus

we are memories
of our selves looking at the
present through a
one-way mirror

we are memories
of our selves looking at the
present through a
one-way mirror

# bridge

an empty house on lavender island
  an empty house on a lavender island
  an empty house on an empty island
with memory made man
the constant bound by space and life span
  the constant bound by space and time
to see the past firsthand
  to meet the past firsthand
  a man made of moments

# chorus

we are memories
of our selves looking at the
present through a
one-way mirror

we are memories
of our selves looking at the
present through a
one-way mirror

younger than when I left
my mind used to race much more

I lost myself for a time
sand quickening
a tapestry of abstract engineering

the constant bound by space and time
a man made of moments

I'm younger than when I left
temporal timbres
sand quickening
sand quickening
